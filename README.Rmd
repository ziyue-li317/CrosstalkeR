# CrosstalkeR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `CrosstalkeR` is to deduce possible pathway involved in a certain cellular phenomenon from RNA-Sequence data, and then indicate possible target downstream or upstream gene for research.

## Description
`CrosstalkR` is a tool that analyzes RNA-Seq data to identify potential pathways involved in a cellular phenomenon. It predicts key upstream and downstream genes, helping researchers uncover biological processes, explore disease mechanisms, and identify therapeutic targets. By integrating gene expression with pathway analysis, `CrosstalkR` enables more informed hypothesis generation and experimental design.

## Installation

To install the latest version of the package:
``` r
# install.packages("pak")
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ziyue-li317/CrosstalkeR", build_vignettes = TRUE)
library("CrosstalkeR")
```

To run the Shiny app:





## Overview

``` r
ls("package:<CrosstalkeR>")
data(package = "<CrosstalkeR>") 
browseVignettes("<CrosstalkeR>")
```
`CrosstalkeR` contains three functions:

1.**prepare_interaction_data**: This function extracts significant GO and KEGG pathways, filters them by q-value, and maps each pathway to associated genes. It then intersects the gene list with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to create a final pathway-gene mapping.

2.**plot_pathway_gene_interactions**: This function visualizes the interaction between pathways and genes by creating a network graph. It uses igraph to plot pathways as nodes and DEGs as connected genes, providing insights into gene-pathway relationships with a visually appealing layout.

3.**rank_pathways**: This function ranks pathways by the number of DEGs associated with each. It creates a bar plot to visualize the ranking, helping identify the most relevant pathways based on DEG involvement. Pathways are sorted by gene count and plotted in descending order.


## Contribution
The author of package is Ziyue Li. 

The author write **prepare_interaction_data** to processes the Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment results, filtering for pathways with a q-value less than 0.1. It then maps the significant pathways to the corresponding genes, focusing only on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by filtering genes based on their Entrez gene IDs. The function returns a list of pathways with their associated DEG gene sets, which can be used for further analysis.

Developed by the author, **plot_pathway_gene_interactions** visualizes the interaction network between pathways and genes. It creates a graph using the igraph package, where the nodes represent genes and pathways, and edges represent the association between them. The function uses the ggraph package to generate a visually appealing plot, which helps in understanding the complex relationships between DEGs and biological pathways.

**rank_pathways** ranks pathways based on the number of associated DEGs and generates a bar plot to visualize the top pathways by gene involvement. The function provides a clear ranking of pathways, aiding in the identification of the most relevant pathways in the context of DEG analysis.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to utilize the functions:

```

# Example Usage: Assuming DESeq2 and enrichment data is in the 'data' file
# Load data (Replace 'data' with your actual file names)

diff_genes <- read.csv("data/diff_gene_deseq2_lactate.csv")  # DESeq2 results with annotated DEGs
go_enrich <- readRDS("data/go_enrich_results.rds")           # Precomputed GO enrichment results
kegg_enrich <- readRDS("data/kegg_enrich_results.rds")       # Precomputed KEGG enrichment results

# Prepare interaction data
pathway_gene_map <- prepare_interaction_data(go_enrich, kegg_enrich, diff_genes)

# Plot pathway-gene interaction network
plot_pathway_gene_interactions(pathway_gene_map)

# Plot ranked pathways
rank_pathways(pathway_gene_map)
```
