Description: CrosstalkR is a tool that analyzes RNA-Seq data to identify potential pathways involved in a cellular phenomenon. It predicts key upstream and downstream genes, helping researchers uncover biological processes, explore disease mechanisms, and identify therapeutic targets. By integrating gene expression with pathway analysis, CrosstalkR enables more informed hypothesis generation and experimental design.
